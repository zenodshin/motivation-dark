darkMotivation
==============

A chrome extension that replaces your chrome new tab page with your ever-rising
age, on a dark background. Based off of maccman's awesome

## About

This chrome extension is based off of the freely available
[Motivation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/motivation/ofdgfpchbidcgncgfpdlpclnpaemakoj)
chrome app. The screenshot on the app store showed a dark background, but I
couldn't find a way to change that in the any app settings. I made this
variation to match my chrome theme. I also plan on adding a bookmark searcher
at some point in the future.

## Installing

2. With Google Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`
