## About

This chrome extension is based off of the freely available
[Motivation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/motivation/ofdgfpchbidcgncgfpdlpclnpaemakoj)
chrome app. The screenshot on the app store showed a dark background, but I
couldn't find a way to change that in the app settings. I made this variation
to match my chrome theme. I also plan on adding a bookmark searcher at some
point in the future.
