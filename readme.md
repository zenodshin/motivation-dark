darkMotivation
==============

A chrome extension that replaces your chrome new tab page with your ever-rising
age, on a dark background.

## About

This chrome extension is based off of the freely available
[Motivation](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/motivation/ofdgfpchbidcgncgfpdlpclnpaemakoj)
chrome app. The screenshot on the app store showed a dark background, but I
couldn't find a way to change that in the app settings. I made this variation
to match my chrome theme. I also plan on adding a bookmark searcher at some
point in the future. Also one day I may push it to the chrome extension store
at some point as well.

## Installing

1.  Clone/download this repo somewhere locally.
2.  With Google Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`
3.  Click `Add unpacked extension...`
4.  Choose the folder you just cloned/downloaded.
5.  Check Google Chrome's new tab page, enter DOB.
